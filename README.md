# game2048
My first game project, a text based 2048 game.
***********************************************************
Welcome to the 2048 game~
In this game there will be a 4*4 table, in each square will randomly generate 2 or 4.
You can choose w, s, a, d, slide up and down, left and right, if you encounter the same number, multiply the number by 2.
When all 16 squares are full and you can no longer slide, the game is over!
1. When the cumulative score exceeds 2048, the player wins!
2. When the cumulative score is less than 2048, the game fails!
